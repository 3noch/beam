The `beam-postgres` backend is the most feature complete SQL backend for beam.
The Postgres RDBMS supports most of the standards beam follows, so you can
usually expect most queries to simply work. Additionally, `beam-postgres` is
part of the standard Beam distribution, and so upgrades are applied
periodically, and new functions are added to achieve feature-parity with the
latest Postgres stable
