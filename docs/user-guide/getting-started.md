Beam is made up of several Haskell packages. The main package is `beam-core`,
which provides core type definitions and common combinators for SQL. It also
provides a basic interface for using backends in a generic way. Beam also comes
with some default backends. Backends for other RDBMSs are available on Hackage
and GitHub.
